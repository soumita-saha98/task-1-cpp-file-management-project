>>C++ File Management System ‚Äì Internship Project

This project is a console-based File Management Tool developed in C++ as part of my internship task. It allows users to read from, write to (overwrite), and append to a text file through a simple menu-driven interface.

üíª Core Features:

1. Write to File (Overwrite):

Prompts the user to enter data.

Overwrites any existing content in the file.

Uses ofstream to write data securely.



2. Read from File:

Reads the entire file line-by-line using ifstream.

Displays the content on the console.

Includes error-handling in case the file doesn‚Äôt exist or cannot be accessed.



3. Append to File:

Takes user input and adds it to the end of the file without erasing existing content.

Uses the ios::app flag with ofstream for appending data.



4. User-Friendly Interface:

A while loop with a switch-case structure provides a clean and repetitive menu for user interaction.

The user can exit the program anytime by selecting option 4.




‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights:

Utilizes standard file handling libraries like <fstream>.

Implements basic exception handling using if (!file) checks.

Handles newline input conflicts with cin.ignore() to ensure smooth input operations after numerical choices.


üìÅ Target File:

All operations are performed on a fixed file named sampleFile.txt. This file is automatically created if it does not exist, and reused for all read/write/append operations.


This project demonstrates my understanding of file I/O operations in C++, user input management, and basic program structuring using functions and control flow. It showcases the foundational skills necessary for building practical applications involving persistent data storage.
